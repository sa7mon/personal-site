					Executive Summary
				</h2>
				<p class="indented">
					The project that I am looking to do for my capstone class is an inventory application. It will be used by members of our cabling team to help keep track of their inventory of cable, jacks, and other items.
				</p>
				<p class="indented">
					I decided to do this because as it currently stands, the person doing inventory has to be emailed a spreadsheet, prints off the spreadsheet, writes everything down on it, and then inputs it back into the spreadsheet on the computer and emails it back to our bookkeeper.
					I will be coordinating this project with my service manager, the cabling team, and our bookkeeper. Each of these people will be interacting with the application at some point, except for my service manager who will be overseeing the project itself.
				</p>
				<p class="indented">
					This project will mostly be done during nights and weekends probably. We will hopefully plan to have the project up and running for sure by April so that I can do any post-project work before the end of the semester.
				</p>
				<p class="indented">
					As for the where of it all, I will probably be doing most of the work from my home during free times, or at my work after business hours.  The meetings with all parties involved will be at CTS during business hours to discuss needs and present my progress.
