  <h3 class="h2 post-title">AttackDefense - Cracking Hashcat Guide </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">AttackDefense is a new site with all sorts of awesome labs an CTFs for training. Best of all: the site is free.
In this guide, I&rsquo;ll detail how to complete the &ldquo;Cracking MD5 Hashes&rdquo; lab, though this strategy should work for most labs in the &ldquo;Hashcat All&rdquo; section. If you are unfamiliar with Hashcat, I&rsquo;d strongly recommend reading the wiki or following Youtube tutorials elsewhere before trying this challenge.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">I was fortunate enough to attend the 2018 Cyber Security Summit in Minneapolis, MN. Here I&rsquo;ve tried to summarize each talk I attended into a small, digestible format, mostly written in their voices.
Student Breakfast By: Ryan Aniol - State of Minnesota
 This was a super informative informal breakfast hosted by Ryan who aimed the talk at the students like myself. It was really nice to hear information directly relevant to my situation.</p>

Intro Now that the Poison box is retired on hackthebox, we can talk publicly about how to gain access to this machine. While this machine was active, I only took the time to gain user access, not all the way to root.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Running Oracle 12c on MacOS </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">In this post, we will go through the steps of installing Oracle 12c in a Docker container and connect to the database using SQL Developer on a Mac. This is a much lighter way of running Oracle locally compared to running a full Windows virtual machine with VMWare or Virtualbox.
1. Install Docker - If your Mac is newer than 2010
You can simply install “Docker for Mac”. Download and install “Docker for Mac” from here (You’ll have to create a quick account to download it.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Electroneum - First Impressions </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">A coworker recently sent me a link to Yet Another Cryptocurrency. Like most people, I&rsquo;m pretty burnt out with all these new coins and ICO&rsquo;s popping up each week. In fact, I get about 5-10 ICO spam emails in my Junk mail folder.
This one looked to be just a little different, though. He was excited because this one allows you to use your phone to mine. I talked to him about how it&rsquo;s a neat idea, but ultimately probably won&rsquo;t be profitable, especially compare to a multi-GPU setup.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Why I switched from Android to iOS </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Note: This article is not just a stringent comparison of Apple vs Android, but a look at the whole picture that I took while deciding which phone to switch to.
A few months ago, my beloved Verizon HTC One M8 began to lose it’s charge at an alarming rate. It would be at 40% battery by lunch time after a day of very moderate use. Luckily, I was due for an upgrade from Verizon.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Allow a Chromecast through a WatchGuard firewall </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Background I recently picked up a Chromecast for my TV so I could stream Netflix easier since XBMC’s addon is terrible if you don’t want to use a keyboard. It was super easy to setup, but after it updated and connected to my WiFi I couldn’t see it from my phone. I did some digging and found that my WatchGuard 25W was the culprit. After I added an any-any rule I was able to see it, but that left it wide-open on my network.</p>

  <h3 class="h2 post-title">Fix “Some settings are managed by your system administrator” in Windows 7 </h3>
  <p class="post-summary">Background A few months back, I was doing cleanup on a system that I had cleaned of malware. Whatever junk was on there had configured a local proxy server to run, but Malwarebytes had ripped it out. The system unfortunately still thought it was supposed to use the proxy server that doesn’t exist; consequently, I had no internet access. That’s an easy enough fix, right? I open Internet Options and change the LAN settings to not use a proxy and close it.</p>
