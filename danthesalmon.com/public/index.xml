      <description>There are a few different ways to run Docker on Proxmox. Here are some instructions and unscientific benchmarks comparing them.</description>

      <description>I have an account on Tumblr, though I seem to be one of the few people still on the site. Over the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed an uptick in the amount of spam accounts following me. A considerable increase, in fact, so I decided to try to quantify how pervasive the problem was.
Searching for Spam The first thing I had to do was create some criteria to use for categorizing accounts as &amp;ldquo;spam&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>AttackDefense - Cracking Hashcat Guide</title>

      <description>AttackDefense is a new site with all sorts of awesome labs and CTFs for training. Best of all: the site is free.
In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll detail how to complete the &amp;ldquo;Cracking MD5 Hashes&amp;rdquo; lab, though this strategy should work for most labs in the &amp;ldquo;Hashcat All&amp;rdquo; section. If you are unfamiliar with Hashcat, I&amp;rsquo;d strongly recommend reading the wiki or following Youtube tutorials elsewhere before trying this challenge.
Note: I would highly suggest you try to complete the lab first without help from this guide.</description>

      <description>I was fortunate enough to attend the 2018 Cyber Security Summit in Minneapolis, MN. Here I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to summarize each talk I attended into a small, digestible format, mostly written in their voices.
Student Breakfast By: Ryan Aniol - State of Minnesota
 This was a super informative informal breakfast hosted by Ryan who aimed the talk at the students like myself. It was really nice to hear information directly relevant to my situation.</description>

      <description>Note: If you are currently trying to get access to this box, I highly recommend you try it yourself first and only use this guide if you really are stuck. Intro Now that the Poison box is retired on hackthebox, we can talk publicly about how to gain access to this machine. While this machine was active, I only took the time to gain user access, not all the way to root.</description>

      <title>Running Oracle 18c on MacOS</title>

      <guid>https://danthesalmon.com/running-oracle-12c-on-macos/</guid>
      <description>Update: May 14, 2019 This article originally contained instructions for running Oracle 12c. The Docker image that was being used was deleted by the author and so was not usable. I have updated the instructions to work again, though the image it uses now runs Oracle 18c. If you need to run 12c specifically, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to look for instructions elsewhere. Some screenshots may now be out of date.
In this post, we will go through the steps of installing Oracle 12c in a Docker container and connect to the database using SQL Developer on a Mac.</description>

      <title>Electroneum - First Impressions</title>

      <description>A coworker recently sent me a link to Yet Another Cryptocurrency. Like most people, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty burnt out with all these new coins and ICO&amp;rsquo;s popping up each week. In fact, I get about 5-10 ICO spam emails in my Junk mail folder.
This one looked to be just a little different, though. He was excited because this one allows you to use your phone to mine. I talked to him about how it&amp;rsquo;s a neat idea, but ultimately probably won&amp;rsquo;t be profitable, especially compare to a multi-GPU setup.</description>

      <title>Moving ZFS datasets between volumes</title>
      <link>https://danthesalmon.com/moving-zfs-datasets-between-volumes/</link>

      <guid>https://danthesalmon.com/moving-zfs-datasets-between-volumes/</guid>
      <description>If you run ZFS like I do (and I think you should) there will probably come at time when you need to migrate a dataset from one volume to another. This was done in FreeNAS (FreeBSD), but the steps should apply to any *nix system with ZFS
The great thing about ZFS is that we can do most of this migration with our services and everything still running.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start by taking a snapshot of the dataset we want to move.</description>

      <title>Why I switched from Android to iOS</title>
      <link>https://danthesalmon.com/why-i-switched-from-android-to-ios/</link>

      <guid>https://danthesalmon.com/why-i-switched-from-android-to-ios/</guid>
      <description>Note: This article is not just a stringent comparison of Apple vs Android, but a look at the whole picture that I took while deciding which phone to switch to.
A few months ago, my beloved Verizon HTC One M8 began to lose it’s charge at an alarming rate. It would be at 40% battery by lunch time after a day of very moderate use. Luckily, I was due for an upgrade from Verizon.</description>
