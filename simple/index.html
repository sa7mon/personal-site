        <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Dan and I'm a college student in Minnesota
                who is currently pursing multiple degrees in Computer Science.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time I love to build computers, see live music,
                and code. I also collect vinyl, watch tons of movies, and
                eat lots of Chinese food. In the future, I hope to be able
                to travel the world more.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have experience using many technologies in various areas
                including desktop imaging and repair, web design, web
                backend programming, and networking. I love learning new
                things and discovering better ways to do things.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have experience programming in HTML5, CSS3, PHP, JS,
                VB.NET, and Java. I also utilize many frameworks and tools
                such as Bootstrap, jQuery, and LESS.
            </p>
